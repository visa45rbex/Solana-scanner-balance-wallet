6.  **Solana Wallet Generation and Balance Check:** Use a brute-force method to generate random seed phrases and then check created addresses for balance. Useful for research and finding active wallets. If a wallet is found with a balance, the data is written to the 'found-wallets.txt' file and also sent via Telegram, provided it's configured.

## Telegram Configuration

To enable Telegram notifications, simply enter your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) into the 'telegram-settings.txt' file, which is located in the program folder.

## Getting Started

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project: Step-by-Step

The project requires a C++ compiler and several dependent libraries. We recommend using **vcpkg** to streamline the installation process.

### Installing Dependencies with vcpkg:

1.  If you haven't already, install **vcpkg** by following the instructions available on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system's PATH environment variable to access it from the command line.
3.  Run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install openssl
    ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install nlohmann-json
    ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install cryptopp
    ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install libsodium
    ```

4.  Once installed, you can proceed with building the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated into your environment by following the instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).
3.  Go to **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The compiled executable will be located in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the following command (adjust as needed for your compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line Interface

Here's how to use the program from the command line:

1.  **-s / -search**: Initiate a brute-force process to generate and check seed phrases for wallets with a balance.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking a specified address.  The program will monitor activity.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets. Replace `<NUMBER>` with the desired wallet count.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet data from a given seed phrase. Replace `<MNEMONIC>` with the seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Display the balance of the specified address within the Solana network.

## Important Notices

-   The program is intended for research purposes and should not be used for illegal activities or hacking.
-   All crypto operations involve risks. Please take measures to ensure your data and wallet security.
